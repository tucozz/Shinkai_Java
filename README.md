ATTENTION: THIS GAME IS STILL INCOMPLETE. By the time You're reading this, who knows what stage of the game I'm in
there's no garantee that it's even playable. Use this source code with caution.

As of now, Thank you for stopping by and any contributions to my learning process are welcome.
I plan to make this game my own with art and independent game mechanics, as well as a better readme when the time comes.
